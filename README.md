# Play Sync

A Chrome extension that syncs HTML5 video playback between multiple clients in real-time. Current implementation uses Firestore for real-time functionality and is built with a lightweight Svelte interface for the browser popup. Built as a proof-of-concept for HTML5 video sync, similar to the Netflix Party extension, but generalized to fit most HTML5 video implementations. Designed to be very lightweight with minimal configuration. No guarantees of stability.
